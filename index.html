        <h3>Introduction to visualisation:</h3>

        <p>This data visualisation was created and published on Sub-reddit /r/visualisation to
            show the ratio of acceptance and objections of the climate change bill during the 117th
            United States Congress, which was attended by 100 senators and 435 representatives from
            either the Republican, Democrat or independent party candidates.</p>

                https://www.reddit.com/r/visualization/comments/qw6bjo/117th_congress_by_party_and_acceptance_of_climate/
            </a>
        </p>

        <h3>Data (What):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each data points represents a member of congress, with each colour code representing a specific party
                (Republican, Democrat or Independent).
                Also, the data described the stance of the political representatives, whether they were climate change
                deniers or caucus.
            </li>

            <li>
                The data attribute is categorical (different parties), nominal with no implicit ordering. The data
                points in then embedded into the visual encoding which is a Pictorial Unit Chart
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Task (Why):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Analyze</strong> : The visual aims to <strong>present</strong> the statistics on the number of
                members of a
                party which is against climate change, and the number of members working towards climate change. It also
                shows the individual breakdown of the number of votes for or against climate change for the individual
                states. There aren't any annotated or derived statistics or trends from the visualisation, overall its
                task action is mainly to present current findings (Casual visualisation).</li>

            <li> <strong>Search</strong>: In essence, the target and location boundary of the visualisation is known and
                the task is to perform a lookup on the congress data and to plot them onto the visualisation.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Query</strong>: There are two elements of the query within this visualisation, one is the
                pairwise comparison between the parties. The visualisation also attempts to summarise the findings onto
                a single visualisation as opposed to identifying trends by plotting representatives and senates from all
                states onto a single data visualisation.
            </li>

            <li>To present the number of members of a party which is against climate change, and
                the number of members working towards climate change. </li>
            <li>To show the individual breakdown of the number of votes for/against climate
                change for the individual states.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Idiom (How):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The contrast of the foreground colours with the background is very low and makes
                the readability very poor</li>

            <li>Colours were not effectively used to convey and create associations. It is not apparent which state has
                more climate deniers or supporters at a glance, perhaps using Gestalt’s Principles (Similarity), can
                group the data points separately into climate supporters and deniers. </li>
            <li>There is no description of what a climate denier is and what makes a
                representative one</li>
            <li>The legend for a climate denier is depicted as a striked out yellow circle with
                a stroke through the centre but the actual representation in the chart is different
                (Does not match with the legend in the chart)</li>
            <li>The representatives are subdivided by their represented states but there is no
                clear idea on what is the purpose of doing so</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Suggestion on how to improve the visualisation with D3.js examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a better colour combinations for the legend</li>
            <li>Alternatively, the data could be plotted using a parliament chart. It could either be sorted on a
                state-level or even party level. At a single glance, the diagram allows viewers to immediately know
                which party has more seats (votes). It significantly reduces the cognitive load on the viewer, if let’s
                say there were to do a comparison between states, they would not have to calculate which states has
                more/less votes as it is already presented clearly in the parliament diagram.
                There should also be a summary of the findings, for example:

                <ul>
                    <li>1. Percentage of Climate Caucus vs Climate Deniers in a regional (north, south east west) level
                        using Choropleth maps/ Bubbles, as we know one of the channel effectiveness principles that can
                        be applied here is also accuracy.</li>
                    <li>2. Percentage of Climate Caucus vs Climate Deniers in state level.</li>

        <h3>Introduction to visualisation:</h3>
        <p>This visualisation was created by Jennifer Nicole Falk and published to the Tableau

        <h3>Data (What) :</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is presented using both heat map table and a parallel coordinate line chart
            </li>
            <li>For the parallel coordinate line chart, it requires a lot of cognitive effort to
                evaluate which country fared well for each of the metrics. </li>
            <li>The dataset (from Kaggle) records the statistics of each metric but the author
                decided to omit it and present just the ranking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Task (Why):</h3>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analyse</strong>: To present the healthiness of various first-world cities across the world.
                    The heatmap is attempting to show which countries have higher ranks across the 7 categories chosen
                    by the author.
                    The parallel coordinate chart attempts varying individual rankings within the 7 categories for the
                    top 10 overall ranked cities.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Search: </strong>
                    The data is presented in a straightforward manner, given the known target (cities), the viewer has
                    to locate it based on the cities ranking.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Query: </strong>
                    The visualisation aims to compare healthy lifestyle rankings of the different countries
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Target: </strong>
                    One attribute which is the ranking of the cities, and also to browse the topology of the network
                    graph to perform comparison.
                </li>


            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Idiom (How):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The 'Overall Rank' metric stacks all of the Top 10 countries together, the data
                is compressed and it feels like there is no significant difference between the
                rankings.</li>
            <li>Line chart is usually used to depict a trend/pattern but in this case the
                trend/pattern is different for all the top 10 countries, and when it is stacked
                together it appears very confusing.</li>
            <li>For the Heat Map Table, the lighter colours are supposed to show the countries
                that are ranked high in the report, and the darker colours are used to depict lower
                rank, but it is confusing.</li>
            <li>The metrics colours blend in with each other, and leave the reader
                confused.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Suggestion on how to improve the visualisation with D3.js examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you convert metrics like Sunlights to a ranking, you lose the “intensity” of the scale. The
                difference between rank 1 and rank 2 for sunlight is not apparent and bould range from 1 hour difference
                to 100 hours difference. Instead we could compare the metrics individually or separately (story telling)
            </li>
        </ul>
