            <h2>1st Visualisation: 117th Congress by Views of Climate</h2>

            <h3>Introduction to visualisation:</h3>
            <p>This data visualisation was created and published on Sub-reddit /r/visualisation to 
            show the ratio of acceptance and objections of the climate change bill during the 117th 
            United States Congress, which was attended by 100 senators and 435 representatives from 
            either the Republican, Democrat or independent party candidates.</p>

            <h3>Data (What):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pictorial Unit Chart, with each data point representing a member of congress, 
                and the colour code represents their party (Republican, Democrat or Independent), 
                also other legends such as climate denier or climate caucus will be applied to the 
                data points.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Task (Why):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To present the number of members of a party which is against climate change, and 
                the number of members working towards climate change. </li>
                <li>To show the individual breakdown of the number of votes for/against climate 
                change for the individual states.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Idiom (How):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The contrast of the foreground colours with the background is very low and makes 
                the readability very poor</li>
                <li>There is no description of what a climate denier is and what makes a 
                representative one</li>
                <li>The legend for a climate denier is depicted as a striked out yellow circle with 
                a stroke through the centre but the actual representation in the chart is different 
                (Does not match with the legend in the chart)</li>
                <li>The representatives are subdivided by their represented states but there is no 
                clear idea on what is the purpose of doing so</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Suggestion on how to improve the visualisation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a better colour combinations for the legend</li>
                <li>Alternatively, the data could be plot using parliament chart for a more 
                effective overview of the voting outcomes.

            <h2>2nd Visualisation: 2021 Healthy Lifestyle Report</h2>

            <h3>Introduction to visualisation:</h3>
            <p>This visualisation was created by Jennifer Nicole Falk and published to the Tableau 
            public website. This visualisation is a visual representation of the linked dataset of 
            10 measures that contribute to a healthy lifestyle.</p>

            <h3>Data (What) :</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is presented using both heat map table and a parallel coordinate line chart
                </li>
                <li>For the parallel coordinate line chart, it requires a lot of cognitive effort to 
                    evaluate which country fared well for each of the metrics. </li>
                <li>The dataset (from Kaggle) records the statistics of each metric but the author 
                    decided to omit it and present just the ranking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Task (Why):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To present the healthiness of various first-world cities across the world. The 
                    heatmap is attempting to show which countries have higher ranks across the 7 
                    categories chosen by the author. The parallel coordinate chart attempts varying 
                    individual rankings within the 7 categories for the top 10 overall ranked 
                    cities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Idiom (How):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The 'Overall Rank' metric stacks all of the Top 10 countries together, the data 
                is compressed and it feels like there is no significant difference between the 
                rankings.</li>
                <li>Line chart is usually used to depict a trend/pattern but in this case the 
                trend/pattern is different for all the top 10 countries, and when it is stacked 
                together it appears very confusing.</li>
                <li>For the Heat Map Table, the lighter colours are supposed to show the countries 
                that are ranked high in the report, and the darker colours are used to depict lower 
                rank, but it is confusing.</li>
                <li>The metrics colours blend in with each other, and leave the reader 
                confused.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Suggestion on how to improve the visualisation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you convert metrics like Sunlights to a ranking, you lose the “intensity” 
                of the scale. Instead we could compare the metrics individually (story 
                telling).</li>
