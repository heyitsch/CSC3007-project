                Which cities are healthiest? Which cities have enablers and detractors for helping their
                residents stay healthy? What are some of the metrics of healthy living? In this data story,
                we try to look into the different factors that contribute to the healthy living of residents
                in 44 different cities across a variety of countries. We also share some of the reasons why
                we think these metrics would contribute to healthy living for the residents, and how some
                of these metrics could relate to other metrics that also affect healthy living.

                        We all know that Obesity is the main cause for major health risks and diseases such
                        as Heart Disease, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. It also poses risks to
                        one’s self confidence and happiness. Research has shown that overweight individuals
                        have high rates of self-stigma, significantly lower body satisfaction and significantly
                        lower happiness level. These are all detrimental factors towards a person’s health,
                        well being and happiness.

                        <b>Which are the “biggest” cities?</b><br>
                        Breakdowns based on Geographical Regions have revealed that ASEAN cities such as Mumbai,
                        Fukuoka, Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei have an average obesity rate of 5.89%. European countries
                        have an average obesity rate of 22%. The obesity rates of American cities comes in at an
                        alarming rate of 34.5%.
                        <br><br>
                        This begs the question, what are the factors that affect obesity? What could be the reasons
                        for such alarming rates? Is it because clean bottles of water are expensive? Or is it
                        due to the lack of varieties in outdoor activities, or even due to the number of
                        available sunshine hours?

                        Do cheaper gym memberships mean lower obesity levels? There seems to be weak correlation.
                        In the countries observed, cheaper gym membership cost does not mean lower percentage of
                        obesity. Studies have shown that you don’t need to go to the gym to get into shape.
                        Alternative workouts such as walking, running, dancing, or yoga at home are great ways
                        to keep fit without going to the gym. This likely explains why there is not much of a
                        correlation.

                        What really makes people happy? There are countless academic studies that have tried to
                        get to the bottom of this. According to the World Happiness Report, the happiness levels
                        could be explained by looking at various tangible and intangible factors such as GDP
                        per capita, social support, generosity. Life expectancy is one of the factors that
                        is used to assess the happiness levels for this healthy lifestyle cities report.
                        Helsinki was ranked the top city in the world and has one of the longest life
                        expectancy at 80.4.

                        Happy people don't just enjoy their lives; they are likely to live longer too. Studies
                        have shown that good general well-being leads to a much more fulfilled and happier life
                        as well as a longer life expectancy. Ecological momentary assessment and analysis on
                        people’s happiness and well being showed a great correlation between mood and mortality.
                        This is demonstrated in Cities such as Sydney and Amsterdam, with one of the highest
                        life expectancy at 81.20, 82.10 and happiness levels of 7.44 and 7.22 respectively,
                        placing them as the 1st and 2nd on the healthy lifestyle ranking.

                        People also have a tendency to exercise more in better weather, afterall who would want
                        to go jogging in the rain? More exercise means less obesity. Sunshine is also related to
                        happiness. Studies have shown that many people are affected by seasonal affective
                        disorder - a disorder which happens due to a reduced amount of sunlight, typically
                        in the fall and winter seasons. Places with more sunlight or with a consistent amount
                        of sunlight throughout the year would naturally have more happy and therefore healthy
                        people.

                        When considered with other variables, here are the cities that not only lead healthier
                        lifestyles, but are more optimised for their residents to lead a healthy lifestyle.
                        Amsterdam comes in first. Perhaps the stereotype of the Dutch people cycling everywhere
                        does have an impact on a healthier lifestyle. Of the top 10 healthiest cities, all but
                        3 of them are in Europe. This perhaps tells of a different mindset from continent to
                        continent and not just from country to country.
